CLI & Capstone Project
Part 1 - Initial Implementation
As an admin for a car company I would like to have system to book cars and view users.
Develop a car booking cli system.
Display a menu options to the user such as:
1. Book Car
2. View All User Booked Cars
3. View All Bookings
4. View Available Cars
5. View Available Electric Cars
6. View all users
7. Exit

When booking a new car you should your system should ask for:
• the user for his id. Each user must have unique identifier (id) which must be generated by the system.
• the car to be booked
There is no right or wrong implementation have a think about the functionality and how you want your system to behave.
Think about the POJOs classes you might need such User, Car, Booking etc...
Think about the service classes you might need for business logic...

Make sure to use packages to organize your code.
User the right naming conventions. for classes, methods and packages
