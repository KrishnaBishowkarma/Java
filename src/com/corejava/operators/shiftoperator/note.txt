Shift Operators in Java

1. Left Shift (`<<`)
- Operation: Shifts all the bits in a number to the left by a specified number of positions.
- Effect: The vacant positions on the right are filled with zeros.
- Usage: Each shift to the left is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2.

2. Right Shift (`>>`)
- Operation: Shifts all the bits in a number to the right by a specified number of positions.
- Effect: The vacant positions on the left are filled with the sign bit (0 for positive numbers, 1 for negative numbers).
- Usage: Each shift to the right is equivalent to dividing the number by 2 (with sign extension).

3. Unsigned Right Shift (`>>>`)
- Operation: Shifts all the bits in a number to the right by a specified number of positions.
- Effect: The vacant positions on the left are filled with zeros, regardless of the sign of the original number.
- Usage: The result is always positive or zero.

Summary of Shift Operators

- Left Shift (`<<`): Shifts bits to the left, filling zeros on the right.
- Right Shift (`>>`): Shifts bits to the right, filling with the sign bit (sign-extended right shift).
- Unsigned Right Shift (`>>>`): Shifts bits to the right, filling zeros on the left (zero-filled right shift).
