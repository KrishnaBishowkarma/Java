### SOLID Principles

S - Single Responsibility:

Each class should have only one sole purpose, and not be filled with excessive functionality.

O - Open Closed:

Classes should be open for extension and closed for modification. In other words, you should not have to rewrite an existing class to implement new features.

L - Liskov Substitution

This means every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

I - Interface Segregation

Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they canâ€™t do. Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.

D - Dependency Injection

Components should depend on abstractions, not on concretions
